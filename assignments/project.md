### Introduction

For your project, you will investigate a cybersecurity topic of your choice. Your project **must** be approved by the instructor, and it should focus on an interesting, relevant issue within computer security. This project gives you the opportunity to explore a topic in greater depth and lead a discussion that enhances the class’s understanding of the subject.

### Your Task

The goal of the project is to examine a specific security issue in greater depth. You will:
- Select a topic related to cybersecurity
- Lead a class discussion on the topic
- Provide the instructor with several relevant articles or websites **ahead** of your discussion date
- Write a technical report
- Deliver a short presentation summarizing the most important aspects of your work

### General Topic Ideas

Example Project Topics:

| Topic                      | Topic                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Encrypted File System      | Hacking Bluetooth                          |
| Compile Time Randomization | Remote desktop application vulnerabilities |
| Bitcoin Transactions       | Searchable encryption                      |
| SDN Security               | QR Codes Security                          |
| Identity spoofing          | RFID spoofing                              |
| Hacking 2FA                | Caller ID spoofing                         |
| SSL Stripping              | Zero Trust                                 |
| Ransomware                 | TOR/I2P                                    |
| Blockchain                 | Keyloggers                                 |

  - [IEEE Cybersecurity](https://cybersecurity.ieee.org/)
  - [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm)

_* Talk to the instructor if multiple people/groups would like to work on the same problem._

### Expectations for Report and Presentation

The paper is based off of the topic you selected for your class discussion. The purpose is to discuss in depth the impact of the issue on both the industry and society as a whole.

The paper should be 3-4 pages single spaced (12pt. font) in length and have at least 4 primary sources. [IEEE format](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf) should be used for citations.

The report should contain the following sections:
- **Introduction**: Clearly describe the threat model or security issue.
- **Background**:Provide relevant historical context or prior work.
- **Discussion**: Analyze the security of the system or explore directions for developing new mechanisms.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize your findings, discuss implications, and outline possible future work.
- **References**: List all cited sources in IEEE format.

Your presentation should highlight the most important aspects of your topic rather than walking through your paper section by section. Focus on clarity, insight, and helping your classmates understand the issue.

Suggested Content
- Motivating or explanatory examples
- Relevant Background
- A brief explanation of how the system or attack works
- Countermeasures
- Key points for discussion

Your presentation should be no more than 7-10 minutes, leaving 2 minutes for Q&A. You should limit your presentation to at most 9 or 10 slides.

### Grading

Your project will be evaluated as a complete package. Both the difficulty of the topic and the quality of your work will factor into your grade.

- More challenging topics may require less extensive analysis
- Simpler topics will require deeper discussion, stronger evaluation, or more substantial results

Both the written report and the presentation contribute to your project grade, with the report carrying more weight.

### Submitting

Upload a zip file containing your code, slides and report to the [Marmoset](https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset/) server.
