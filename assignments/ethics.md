Cyber Security Ethics
====================================

**Spring 2026**

Even though this is an introductory course in Computer Security, you will encounter concepts and techniques that could be misused for hacking, penetration, or attacks on computer systems.

Throughout the semester, we will examine a variety of attacks, explorations, and implementations—some of which are significant and potentially dangerous if applied irresponsibly.

While these topics are essential to understanding Computer Security, using them outside a controlled, authorized environment may violate institutional policies as well as local, state, federal, or international laws. Such misuse can carry severe consequences. In some cases, even attempting to probe a system for weaknesses without permission can result in disciplinary action, civil liability, or criminal charges, including expulsion, fines, or imprisonment.

The mere presence of a vulnerability does not justify exploiting it. These matters involve not only professional ethics but also YCP policy and applicable laws. If you are ever unsure about what actions are permissible, consult the instructor before proceeding.

Acting lawfully and ethically is your responsibility. Carefully read the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act [CFAA]( http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:18%20section:1030%20edition:prelim)), a federal statute that broadly criminalizes computer intrusion. This is one of several US laws that govern “hacking.”
Cyber Criminals are hunted down by [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber), [Secret Service <sup>*</sup>](https://www.secretservice.gov/investigation/cyber), [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) and many more.

Understand what the law prohibits — you don’t want to end up like:
